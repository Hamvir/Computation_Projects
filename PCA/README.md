# Principal Component Analysis

## Problem Statement
You are given a matrix $$A ∈ R^{m×n}$$ and are required to run a PCA on this matrix to reduce its dimension(feature) from n to k, where k is user input.

## Input format:
Create a function so that it returns m number of strings of following format:
$$[x_1,...., x_n]$$
m is the number of data points
n is the number of feature

## How to use:
>Download the py file.

>open it any python compiler like spyder

>The user should have a function that gives input in the prescribed format when called

>Read the output

>The output is a reduced set of m number of data points

An example function(exe file) has been given for reference you can create your own function and just replace the name in the code or you can use the same name.
