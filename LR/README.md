# LINEAR REGRESSION

## Problem Statement
Given a set of m data points X of n-dimensions(features) and we need to find best estimate of equation $$y_i = w^Tx_i + b $$
$$x_i ∈ R^{m}\ and\ y_i ∈ R$$
That is we need to find best w and b so that the squared error is minimised
## Solution:

### Assumption:-

Code is written assuming that m >> n so that we can safely assume $$rank(A^T.A) = rank(A) = n$$
For further explanation refer the pdf.

## Input format:
Create a function so that it returns m number of strings of following format:
$$y ,[x_1,...., x_n]$$
m is the number of data points
n is the number of feature

## How to use:
>Download the py file.

>open it any python compiler like spyder

>The user should have a function that gives input in the prescribed format when called

>Read the output

An example function(exe file) has been given for reference you can create your own function and just replace the name in the code or you can use the same name.
